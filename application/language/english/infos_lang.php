$lang['aboutContent']					= "<p>Get ready for Montreal's goriest parade ever: the Montreal Zombie Walk on October 22nd, in partnership with SPASM Festival!</p>
										<p>The living-dead will begin creeping at the Mont-Royal metro station at 3:30pm. After the mob has gathered, the zombies will stumble their way through the Plateau Mont-Royal and Latin Quarter before invading Club Soda, where the best zombie movies from SPASM's ten glorious years will be screened around 6pm. This will also be your chance to have your picture taken in our photo booth and participate in our zombie costume contest.</p>
										<p>The Montreal Zombie Walk, including the admission to Club Soda is a FREE event for zombies and other creatures alike.</p>
										<p>The Fringe Festival crew will also come back from the dead to join the bloody procession and supply succulent brain and other body parts to all the starving zombies. </p>
										<p>Don't miss this year's Montreal Zombie Walk â€¦ it is sure to raise some corpses as we approach the Halloween season!!!</p>
